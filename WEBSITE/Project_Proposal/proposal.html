    <h2> MEMORY CLOUDS - Project Proposal</h2>
    </ul>
    <p>
        DESCRIPTION
        <br><br>
        My project focuses on the importance of memories, the role of digital media as a means for remembrance, and how we create meaningful connections to others. In recent times, our personal histories have become more accessible with the help of numerous cloud inventories and online backup systems. Having direct access to our timelines means that we can navigate time in new ways, forging connections to realities outside of our own. The rise of modern technology has changed the way we interact with each other, making it easier to communicate and exchange information. This project aims to connect the user’s online experience to my digital archive, being able to be manipulated to generate new ‘memory clouds’ with their own. 
        <br><br>
        The website will contain various links from my life / digital archives, which could be mixed and combined with the user's own media files (images, videos, audio, texts). There will be a drop box in which one could include their personal media to merge into mine, contained within the website. By using sliders and crossfaders to manipulate the density of each memory, and transparency effects to overlay visuals, the data would be selected by the user, blending memories from their own archives into the liminal space, creating new collaborative memories within the digital cloud. These floating memories create connections, letting the user search for specific keywords by using hashtags and links, moving the viewer around the website in a smoothly flowing manner. I am deeply interested in exploring how information can be accessed, and how people create connections within these digital structures and frameworks.
        <br><br>
        The interface will include gliding movements when switching between different memories, as if connected by lines on a globe. This feeling will help destabilize the user, setting them free in a playful process of discovery. This website will encourage them to explore new connections with the unknown, showing the malleability of memory, and embracing spontaneous creation. Collaboration is at the core of this project, blending digital and human forms of memory, using the space as a platform for collective exploration.
