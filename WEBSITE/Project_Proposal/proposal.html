      Project Proposal</h2>

        <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
        <br><br>
        My project focuses on the importance of memories, the role of digital media as a means for remembrance, and how we create meaningful connections to others. In recent times, our personal histories have become more accessible with the help of numerous cloud inventories and online backup systems. Having direct access to our timelines means that we can navigate time in new ways, forging connections to realities outside of our own. The rise of modern technology has changed the way we interact with each other, making it easier to communicate and exchange information. This project aims to connect the user’s online experience to my digital archive, being able to be manipulated to generate new ‘memory clouds’ with their own. 
        <br><br>
        The website will contain various links from my life / digital archives, which could be mixed and combined with the user's own media files (images, videos, audio, texts). There will be a drop box in which one could include their personal media to merge into mine, contained within the website. By using sliders and crossfaders to manipulate the density of each memory, and transparency effects to overlay visuals, the data would be selected by the user, blending memories from their own archives into the liminal space, creating new collaborative memories within the digital cloud. These floating memories create connections, letting the user search for specific keywords by using hashtags and links, moving the viewer around the website in a smoothly flowing manner. I am deeply interested in exploring how information can be accessed, and how people create connections within these digital structures and frameworks.
        <br><br>
        The interface will include gliding movements when switching between different memories, as if connected by lines on a globe. This feeling will help destabilize the user, setting them free in a playful process of discovery. This website will encourage them to explore new connections with the unknown, showing the malleability of memory, and embracing spontaneous creation. Collaboration is at the core of this project, blending digital and human forms of memory, using the space as a platform for collective exploration.

        Ben Fry’s Valence was the project that initially guided me towards my concept. I was very interested in using data clouds to share online information with the user. I like his use of spherical lines to create worlds with floating text, connecting data sets together in a simple yet abstract way. Valence is based on biological data, and was developed as his thesis entitled ‘Organic Information Design’. His use of large information sets intrigued me and pushed me to conceptualize a version in which the user could have access to ‘memory clouds’, morphing them in a dynamic manner. Valence utilizes a three-dimensional data visualizer which evolves over time, analyzing text and creating connections inside the complex grid of information.

        This interplanetary website has a similar look and functions in an intuitive way which highly appealed to me. The smoothness of the zooming effect is very well done, and creates an amazing sensation for the viewer as you get closer to the internal structure of the cosmos. The scroll wheel is a great tool to include, due to its simplicity and active function. I want to use sliders and crossfaders to manipulate data on the website, for maximum interactivity.

        The website’s circular look and simplicity works well to convey its concept, using the clickable grid to activate information and images. Although it utilizes a ‘flat’ perspective, the page still retains its smooth function and aligns nicely with what I envisioned when brainstorming for my project. The grid becomes a maze in which we can get lost and discover new information.

        <b>COMPARISON</b>
        <br><br>
        My project will be more intricate due to its concept, based on the user's ability to mix and manipulate online media sources with their own personal archives to create interesting AV combinations, transforming memories into new creative amalgamations. The online environment will have the ability to change dynamically in real-time according to the users’ input and digital interactions (camera, mouse, keyboard, microphone). By storing & retrieving data, the website will have the ability to dynamically evolve as an explorable space. My focus is on the use of information clouds, media hyperlinks, mapping audio and video fragments to the user, creating an interactive archive and AV mixer, to combine into new combinations, charting connections with keywords & hashtags.
