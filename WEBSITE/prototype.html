        <b>Concept & Layout</b>
        <br><br>
        As my final project, I am building a three-dimensional node based organism which reacts to text prompts entered by the user. At the bottom of the page, there will be a drop down menu to select one of ten ‘dreamstates’, tagged with keywords to connect them into specific categories. 
        <br><br>
        Once selected, it will be possible for the user to share a personal thought or feeling using the input box. Their words will then be cataloged and displayed as large floating text, linking it to other dreams and memories, creating an evolving tapestry of collaborative storytelling.
        <br><br>
        Different nodes will reflect certain moods, connecting phrases together, forming non-linear types of narratives, a cosmic ‘cadavre exquis’. The quantity of nodes presented on-screen will reflect the texts associated with each of them, a growing structure of fragmented dreams, becoming one.
        <br><br>
        By hovering around the screen, participants will have access to full control of the webspace, zooming in and out of range, moving around freely. I have programmed other reactive 3D projects using Blender, TouchDesigner, and MaxMSP, I now look forward to exploring the possibilities of ThreeJS and WebGL.
