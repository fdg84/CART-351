        <a href="https://artbase.rhizome.org/wiki/Main_Page">Rhizome ArtBase</a>
        <br><br>
        The illustrious Rhizome ArtBase is a special online archive for digital & net based works created between 1983 and our current time. As we browse the page, we encounter a multitude of works ranging from interactive pieces, video works, ancient web pages, online experiments and other interesting digital creations. The Rhizome archive was established in 1999 and contains over 2,200 artworks, many of them include an external URL which links the viewer to the original webpage. Artists could clone or link their works and submit them to the ArtBase for archival purposes, otherwise they would have to upkeep the works themselves. This created many issues, many works have been lost to time due to the loss of domains and other platforms hosting the works at the time of creation. Since 2015, Rhizome has been developing new ways to maintain and preserve their digital archive, keeping these rare works in circulation and accessible to the general public. Some tools they have developed include the Emulation-as-a-Service framework, allowing artworks to be seen online in legacy software environments, and Conifer, (Rhizomeâ€™s own version of the Webrecorder platform), allowing network preservation of dynamic web content. They received a National Endowment Humanities grant in 2020 which helped them finalize the first phase of the complete overhaul of the software infrastructure. They also reimplemented the use of  Linked Open Data (LOD) in 2021, updating numerous works with additional metadata. LOD makes it easier to connect data across a wide range of digital repositories, facilitating the maintenance of large digital collections.

        <br><br>
        Google's awesome archive of Chrome Experiments showcases the works of creators all around the world. The projects usually include helpful resources to push your creativity and guide you as you explore a wide array of test codes and other digital tools. Whether it may be AI based music experiments, interactive maps of the cosmos or scientific visualizations, there are plenty of immersive projects to explore and get inspired by. For my final class project, I have been heavily inspired by the webgl globe models to include within my own experiments, wanting to create a moveable sphere where users can pin data to the website, creating an ecosystem of thoughts, dreams and memories. Flame by Xiaohan Zhang includes their three.js code on github, as do many other projects, which can really entice you to explore new ways of coding and sharing with people on a global perspective. There are incredible particle system simulations which can be used in a variety of ways. I am drawn to these projects due to their scientific nature, yet explore the artistic side of nature, earth, and space. Many of these projects include map visualizations as a basis for creative works. Movement plays a large role in these works, the interactivity of the user and the camera, pushing us to see and observe in ways not usually possible. I spent an evening exploring Andrew Wang-Hoyer's experiment The Chaos Game, a colorful fractal generator with a multitude of randomizable functions to play with, creating hypnotic patterns and seeing mathematics generate complex images in real time. I also enjoyed aimlessly navigating A Selfless Society by Julie Freeman & Marcin Ignac, floating in a soft pink 3D atmosphere amongst slow moving digital organisms. Jason Farwell's Wildflowers was also a beautiful yet alien rendition of malleable flowers swaying softly in darkness. Truly an immersive and wonderful project to dive into.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poietic_Generator">Poietic Generator</a>
        <br><br>
        The Poietic Generator was created in 1986 by French digital artist Olivier Auber in and officially developed 1987 with the help of numerous contributors, under the free art label. The social-network game is built within a 2D matrix like most board games, mainly inspired by the exquisite corpse, and Life (a cellular automaton conceived by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970). Contrary to Conway's self-playing game, Auber's game involves multiple players, but which can only draw one pixel at a time, controlling graphic elements on a shared global matrix. All actions are revealed in real time, continuously recreating new formations of the shared image online, like a visual snakes and ladders or cat and mouse game, where you place a pixel but it may be erased or drawn over by another unseen participant the very instant you placed it within the page. This collective process unfurls before your eyes, perpetually moving from one image to the next, morphing into new versions of itself, an eternal digital ouroboros. The project is based on the concept of autopoiesis and demonstrates the ongoing process of self-organization as a continuous regeneration of the communal image. The project even initiated a new form of research under the guise of the "Art of Speed". The evolving mosaic is a fun and interactive way to explore collective artforms, in an anonymous way. The results vary in a multitude of juxtapositions, colors, contrasts, and dynamic abstractions. There have been multiple versions of the Poietic Generator through the years, slowly staying updated with the technology of the time.

        <a href="https://www.decontextualize.com/2015/08/the-ephemerides/">The Ephemerides</a>
        <br><br>
        Allison Parrish's project The Ephemerides fuses together her love of generative poetry and space probes, both of which engage with the unknown, the nonsensical, the inhospitable, to reveal what lies beyond these invisible borders. The work consists of a bot which takes random images from NASA's OPUS database and connects it with a computer generated poem, directly posted onto Twitter, creating fun and weird amalgamations of text and image. Through this simple yet contemplative action, the poetry is formed by parsing through two main sources: Astrology by Sepharial and The Ocean And Its Wonders by R. M. Ballantyne. The lyrical content may seem a bit detached but it is exactly this effect that Parrish wants to tap into, observing through a robotic lens, hoping to create something magnificent and beautiful with something that may be a bit technical or too scientific. The results are interesting, connecting the dots between technology and the more human self, posing questions and never really getting any answers. The source data was made with the Pattern program, separating sentences into new data structures. The poems would then be created by randomly selecting various clauses and constituents, sharing speech patterns to enable semi-cohesive sentence structures. The broken up juxtapositions created end up forming various poetic patterns, alluding to space and other science related vocabulary. It engulfs you within its non-linear thinking process, pushing you to explore new ways of seeing the cosmos, and ourselves lost within it, continually searching for meaning, purposefully hidden within the nonsense of it all.
